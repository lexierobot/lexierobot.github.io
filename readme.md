## Second Design Draft
- colorblock 1 page scroll
- After weeks of sitting on this, I was no longer loving my color palette or layout ideas, and was finding Bootstrap irritating.

## Third Design Draft
- colorful, multi-page design
- wanted to do a pinterest style masonry layout for portfolio projects
- built with CSS Grid, found out masonry would require some javascript
- looked at some plugin type solutions for masonry layout, but I was feeling commited to hand coding everything.

### Moodboard in Figma:
- turned to Pinterest, dribbble, awwwards for inspiration
