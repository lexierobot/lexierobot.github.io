                    <p>I’m Lexie, a graphic designer and marketer located in the Augusta, GA area. I’m currently enrolled in a local bootcamp learning full-stack web development.
                    <br><br>
                    I have always been a lover of art and design. As a child I cut clothing designs out of construction paper and got my first subscription to Vogue at 11. I watched HGTV and drew up interior design schemes for my childhood home. At school I loved English, Math, and Art.
                    <br><br>
                    I started college as an English major at Augusta University but ended with an Associate’s Degree in Design & Media Production Technology from Augusta Technical College. During that time I represented ATC at the 2012 Skills USA Competition, competing in the category of Advertising Design. I won the gold medal at both the state and national levels.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then I’ve worked as a Marketing Manager for two businesses in the Augusta area —first for a real estate agency and then for a flooring store. In these roles I created advertisements, generated new content including copywriting, managed Wordpress websites, created and monitoring Facebook and Google Ads, focused on generating leads, and much more.</p>

                        <div class="desktop-img">

                         </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>While working at the flooring store I was given a unique opportunity to help my boss grow his startup idea: ICER Coolers. Together we designed, sourced, imported, and sold coolers in a physical retail location as well as on Amazon and our own e-commerce store. During this time I was not only the marketing manager — I worked in every role and even managed a small team of employees. It feels impossible to sum up everything I learned in 3.5 years of ICER in just a couple of paragraphs, but I liken it to earning a 4 year Bachelor’s Degree in business.
                    <br><br>
                    We sold ICER in 2019 and I then chose to enroll in a coding bootcamp to further my knowledge of web design & development.</p>
